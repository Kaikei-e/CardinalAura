# CardinalAura

## What's this ?

CardinalAura is a comprehensive application that utilizes RSS feeds and is available across multiple platforms.  
It builds upon CurioNoah, offering a range of complex features. The primary function is the subscription to RSS feeds. 
This is accompanied by timeline displays of the feeds, search capabilities for stored RSS data, and in the future, 
it aims to employ deep learning techniques for summarizing feeds, suggesting user preferences, and discovering new feeds based on those preferences.  




## Aim

While it's an ambitious project incorporating multiple functionalities, its singular aim is to enhance one's technical skills.  
The adoption of Rust and Tauri is specifically to improve proficiency in Rust.
